# Finetuning BLOOM for Vietnamese news summarization task

This repo contains the code of finetuning, evaluating and experimenting with mainly BLOOM and some other LLMs for the Vietnamese news summarization task.

We have two branches:
- `main`: Finetuning with the vietnews dataset
- `tingpt-data`: Finetuning with the news scraped on our own and summarizations generated by ChatGPT

The main process of training is in `finetune.ipynb`. `evaluate.py` and `metrics_cal.py` is used for evaluation and calculating scores. Finally, `demo.py` is used to launch the model to a gradio interface.
